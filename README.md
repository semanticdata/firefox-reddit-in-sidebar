# Reddit in Sidebar
## Notice: this addon is ***NOT*** currently published at addons.mozilla.org
A Firefox WebExtension to display [Reddit](old.reddit.com/.compact) in the sidebar.

This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Reddit web app.

Press `Alt+Shift+8` to toggle the sidebar. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Llama Life in Sidebar -> Options.

> Note: I am using old.reddit.com/.compact. After running some tests, it is the best experience to get Reddit in the sidebar.

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Reddit on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their webapp in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Reddit in any way.
