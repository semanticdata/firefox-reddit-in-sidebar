# Reddit in Sidebar

A Firefox WebExtension to display [Reddit](https://reddit.com/) in the sidebar.

This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Reddit web app.

Press `Alt+Shift+5` to toggle the sidebar. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Llama Life in Sidebar -> Options.

> Note: I did not use old.reddit.com because it does not work correctly.
